When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When the most recent commit made is in working or presentable condition, I would use
    remote repository rather than local repository,i.e. go public. Otherwise when some one
    else has made a significant contribution which is logical then I would go to remote repo
    than work local
