When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When the most recent commit made is in working or presentable condition, I would use
    remote repository rather than local repository,i.e. go public. Otherwise when some one
    else has made a significant contribution which is logical then I would go to remote repo
    than work local

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There may be more than one contributors for a project/repository and there might be 
    frequent update in different branch which is not relavent to my current branch for the given 
    time so it is better to pull changes manaully as and when need be.
