When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When the most recent commit made is in working or presentable condition, I would use
    remote repository rather than local repository,i.e. go public. Otherwise when some one
    else has made a significant contribution which is logical then I would go to remote repo
    than work local

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There may be more than one contributors for a project/repository and there might be 
    frequent update in different branch which is not relavent to my current branch for the given 
    time so it is better to pull changes manaully as and when need be.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead 
of another?
    
    Fork copies an existing repository from the repository within github to our location of 
    repositories. clone is to copy repository from github or local git to local git.
    branches create new commits when additional featues or contributions are made

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    If the last known state of the remote is stored locally then we can get to know if there
    was any change that was made in both local and remote if any present.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would 
be harder?

    We could use one drive or other storage space. but since there is no possiblity of pull 
    request one drive would be harder.
