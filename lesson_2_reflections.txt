 What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
     On initializing a repository by using 'git init', one can see a hidden folder .git being created. This is an empty repository with 
     zero commits and git HEAD uninitialized. Thus giving error on running git log. We can check if it is empty by running git status.
     We need to intialize a repositry to create a repository where we can add our commits with respective messages
How is a staging area different from working directory and repository?
What value do you think it offers?
    Staging area acts as a temporary place where one can work on set of files undergoing changes during a commit while working directory contains can contain untracked files and repository contains tracked files.During the intial commit or subsequent commits, there are chances that multiple files are changed for a same logic or due to data dependency in a file which is not in repository. In these cases multiple files need to be added/commited to the repository at same time by adding the files in a staging area one can store all the files that can be commited once all logical changes are made.
